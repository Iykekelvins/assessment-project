# Assessment Project

A one-page e-commerce product listing website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Deployed on Vercel

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

I was only given mobile designs, so I had to figure out the tablet and desktop layouts myself. I went with a mobile-first approach and used Tailwind's responsive classes to make it work across different screen sizes.

### What I Built

- Product grid that adapts to different screens
- Simple navigation
- Product display cards
- No cart functionality (wasn't required)

### Project Structure

```

├── shared/        # Navbar component
├── public/        # Images and assets
└── README.md
```

## Features

- Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Clean product layout
- Responsive design
- Fast loading

## Areas for Improvement

- Could add search and filters
- Better accessibility features
- The desktop/tablet layouts could be improved with actual designs
